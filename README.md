# Answering-MIS-and-DSS-Questions-By-Using-Power-BI
We tried to bring the large and difficult to understand dataset to a level that can be understood by everyone. We tried to find answers to a number of MIS and DSS questions by using different methods and techniques. We know that no matter how large the data we have, it can be useful when filtering, associating and visualizing correctly. We supported Business Intelligence processes by converting data into information.

BI Tool Used		:  Microsoft Power BI


We have used the Goal-Question-Metric method. As it is a comprehensive goal, we set different questions for the same goal as two teammates. So we worked on 4 different MIS questions and 2 different DSS questions for one goal.
ISBGS data set is used during the project. ISBGS is a dataset that contains data of the various projects. The data set we use includes data from 7,518 different projects. There are many different metrics from technical details to demographic details. Thanks to these metrics, different examinations can be made on software projects and many questions can be answered.
